## Stoplight CLI

Another point of entry into the Stoplight Universe, is through the **Stoplight CLI**. 

## What is Stoplight CLI?

Stoplight CLI is a command-line tool, built as an NPM module, which can publish changes to Stoplight, and have them show up in Explorer just like any other project. 

**Stoplight CLI** is designed for those who use a different version control system other than Git. 

If you make use of Mercurial, SVN, SourceSafe, Bazaar or another service to keep your work organized, Stoplight has you covered.

> ** ðŸ‘‰ Note:** Projects you add through CLI ****won't be editable in Studio, but the content will be available to read and search like anything else. 

1. Navigate to theÂ **Add Projects**Â section and click onÂ via **Stoplight CLI.**
2. Give this project a name, and clickÂ **Add Project**. This is going to create an empty project where you can  push data.
3. Copy the **command**Â on the screen.
