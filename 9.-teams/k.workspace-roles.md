# Workspace Roles

Stoplight is an all-in-one platform that covers all integral parts of the API lifecycle including design, documentation, development, and governance.

This requires different stakeholders from your organization to be on the platform, and you can invite them as **members** on your workspace.

Having all your collaborators on a single platform helps promote **visibility** and **reusability** of artifacts across your organization, but you may not want these stakeholders to have the same level of access. You can easily limit that by defining their **workspace and project roles.**

> To find out how to invite members to your workspace and assign roles, read our guide [**Inviting Team Members**](d.inviting-your-team.md)

Workspace roles on Stoplight are predefined according to varying access needs. You can assign these roles whenever you invite a new member to your workspace. These roles include:

**Viewer**: Viewers can view documentation and consume mock servers. Viewers are usually developers and other stakeholders inside the organization consuming the API but don't need to make changes to API design and docs. Viewers can view **published branches** of all internal projects and **all branches** of projects they are granted direct access to. [Learn how to add members to a project](l.project-roles.md)

**Maker**: Makers in addition to viewer access, can create and edit all internal projects and projects they are granted direct access to. Makers are usually product managers, technical writers and architects creating/editing API designs and docs.

**Admin**: Admins in addition to maker access can manage team members and make changes to the workspace like landing page content and themes. Admins are usually team leads onboarding their respective teams to the platform. 

**Owner**: An owner in addition to admin access can manage team members, billing and add/edit projects. Owners are usually API Champions leaders and managers leading cross-team efforts.

**Guests**: Guests can view documentation for projects that they are granted explicit access to. Guests are usually partners who required authentitcated access to the documentation.

**Billing**: Billing roles are usually reserved for operations folks that need to manage billing across the workspace.
